# Predicting-Laptop-Prices
This project focuses on predicting laptop prices using machine learning techniques. I performed exploratory data analysis and visualizations in a Jupyter Notebook, followed by building a regression model using RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble. Hyperparameter tuning was done via GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

The model predicts laptop prices based on key features: Processor_Speed, RAM_Size, and Storage_Capacity. A Streamlit web app was developed to provide real-time price predictions, and joblib was used to serialize the trained model for deployment.

Tools: Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Joblib, Numby
